# K-means-Clustering-Implemented-in-C
This is an amature implementation of the K-meaans clustering algorithm in the C language.
I used cosine similarity and Euclidean distance as the similarity measures.
The code works by reading values from a CSV file, with the rows reprenting data points and the columns represent the features.
The code was tested with the IRIS dataset the IRIS.csv file, the resulting clusters are not accurate.
